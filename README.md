# The Forest of Dooooooom

2D Survival game in C++. No big plans other than having fun making it.

`11_Camping_16x16.png` and `Modern_Exteriors_Characters_Scout_16x16_1.png` were
created by [LimeZu][limezu]. His license doesn't allow me to redistribute it.
Since they are a really good (paid) asset, I think it is more fair to him/her
if anyone interested in running this project visit the artist's website and
consider buying the "Modern Exteriors" package.
