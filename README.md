# The Forest of Dooooooom

2D Survival game in C++. No big plans other than having fun making it.

`11_Camping_16x16.png` was created by [LimeZu][limezu]. His license doesn't
allow me to redistribute it. Since they are a really good (paid) asset, I think 
it is more fair to him/her if anyone interested in running this project visit
the artist's website and consider buying the "Modern Exteriors" package.
