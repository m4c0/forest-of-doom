# The Forest of Dooooooom

2D Survival game in C++. No big plans other than having fun making it.

Required tilesets were created by [LimeZu][limezu]. His license doesn't allow 
me to redistribute it. Since they are a really good (paid) asset, it is fair to
him/her/them if anyone interested in running this project visit the artist's
website and buy these packages:

* [Modern Exteriors][limezu-ext]
* [Modern Interiors][limezu-int]
* [Modern User Interface][limezu-ui]
