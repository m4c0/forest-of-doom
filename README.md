# The Forest of Dooooooom

2D Survival game in C++. No big plans other than having fun making it.

Required tilesets were created by artists I found on itch.io: [LimeZu][limezu]
and [Crusenho][crusenho]. Their respective licenses doesn't allow me to
redistribute it. Since they are a really good (paid) asset, it is fair to
him/her/them if anyone interested in running this project visit the artist's
website and buy these packages:

* [Complete UI Essential Pack][crusenho-cuep]
* [Modern Exteriors][limezu-ext]
* [Modern Interiors][limezu-int]
* [Modern User Interface][limezu-ui]
